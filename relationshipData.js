//this is not needed but see i can make a class in Javascriipt as well but because javascript can just dynamically create objects i was to lazy to use the class
class relationshipData {
    constructor(RecordID, managerID, ReporteeID) {
        this.RecordID = RecordID;
        this.managerID = managerID;
        this.ReporteeID = ReporteeID;
    }
}
